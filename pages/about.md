Hey, I'm Alexey.

I'm a software developer and solo-enterpreneur from Belgrade, Serbia.

Through most of my professional career I have worked as a software developer. I have started as a PHP developer back then I was in the university, but soon switched to Java and got stuck around it for quiet some time. But Java was not the only thing I was using â€” I have always looking around in search of something new and interesting that I can try to explore while playing with my pet projects.

many years later I have switched to management and pretty soon I have burnnt out. I dont think that being manager is something that caused that. At least, not the only reason. So, after almost 20 years of working for somebody else I have finally decided to try something new and pursuit the completely different path.

So, now I'm (still) the solo-enterpreneur writing apps by myself. And not only writing, but designing, marketing, supporting, accounting, etc.
