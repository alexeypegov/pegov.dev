I have started as a PHP developer back then I was in the university, but soon switched to Java and got stuck around it for quiet some time. But Java was not the only thing I was using â€” I have always looking around in search of something new and interesting that I can try to explore while playing with my pet projects.</p>\n<p>many years later I have switched to management and pretty soon I have burnnt out. I dont think that being manager is something that caused that. At least, not the only reason. So, after almost 20 years of working for somebody else I have finally decided to try something new and pursuit the completely different path.</p>\n<p>So, now I'm (still) the solo-enterpreneur writing apps by myself. And not only writing, but designing, marketing, supporting, accounting, etc.</p>\n", :slug "about", :link "/about.html", :uuid #uuid "ff30ff50-1def-3103-a3d2-1134aff2c123"}, :target-crc "2e570a66", :type :single}}
